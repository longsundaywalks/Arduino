/*Refer to .S Traffic Light Code

To correctly use this code, run the .S file (TrafficLight.S)

Ground a digital wire to the negative row of a breadboard.

Connect resistors to the cathode leg (shorter) of LEDs and another wire to the anode (longer) leg of the LED

For assembly, you will be using digital pins 13 - 10 and 50 - 53 using PORT B (DDRB)

Once these are all connected, you can run the program and it should function like a traffic light with
pedestrian lights.
